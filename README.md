# project-rock_paper_scissors
In this project, I will initially be making a basic Rock Paper Scissors game, to be run in the console. It will ask for a number of rounds to be played, and you will be able to select a 'weapon' for each round. 

Eventually, this will be expanded with a GUI and more interactive features.
